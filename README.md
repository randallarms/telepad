# TelePad

Simple custom warp & teleportation plugin for Bukkit on Minecraft (MCv1.12).

TelePad features the ability to travel between locations and worlds via simple command. The plugin has no dependencies and will likely have no effect on any other plugins already installed, even other teleport plugins! Always back-up to be sure, though.

Any forks, branches, and pull requests are welcome! Please feel free to voice criticism to better the project, as well.
